      The image id to use for calico/node.

      The image id to use for calico/kube-controllers.
  ipip:
    type: string
    default: Never
    description: |
      IPIP mode. Must be one of "Always", "CrossSubnet", or "Never".

    description: |
      NAT outgoing traffic
  cidr:
    type: string
    default: "192.168.0.0/16"
    description: |
      Network CIDR assigned to Calico. This is applied to the default Calico
      pool, and is also communicated to the Kubernetes charms for use in
      kube-proxy configuration.
  manage-pools:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |
      If true, a default pool is created using the cidr and ipip charm
      configuration values. Any unrecognized pools are deleted.
  global-as-number:
    type: int
    default: 64512
    description: |
      Global AS number.
  subnet-as-numbers:
    type: string
    default: "{}"
    description: |
      Mapping of subnets to AS numbers, specified as YAML. Each Calico node
      will be assigned an AS number based on the entries in this mapping.

      Example value: "{10.0.0.0/24: 64512, 10.0.1.0/24: 64513}"

      If a node's IP matches any of the specified subnets, then the
      corresponding AS number is used instead of the global one.

      If a node's IP matches no subnets, then the global AS number will be
      used instead.

      If a node's IP matches multiple subnets, then the most specific subnet
      will be used, e.g. a /24 subnet will take precedence over a /16.
  unit-as-numbers:
    type: string
    default: "{}"
    description: |
      Mapping of unit IDs to AS numbers, specified as YAML. Each Calico node
      will be assigned an AS number based on the entries in this mapping.

      Example value: "{0: 64512, 1: 64513}"

      This takes precedence over global-as-number and subnet-as-numbers.
  node-to-node-mesh:
    type: boolean
    default: true
    description: |
      When enabled, each Calico node will peer with every other Calico node in
      the cluster.
